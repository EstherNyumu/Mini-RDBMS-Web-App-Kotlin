# Mini RDBMS Web Application (Kotlin)

**Author:** Esther Mutheu Nyumu

## Overview

This project demonstrates a **mini relational database management system (RDBMS)** implemented in Kotlin, along with a simple web application that allows users to interact with the database. The project was built as part of the **Pesapal Junior Developer '26 Challenge**, where the goal was to showcase the ability to design and implement a database system with CRUD functionality, primary and unique keys, basic joins, and an interactive interface.

The application supports **user registration**, **placing orders**, and an **admin dashboard** for managing users and orders. It is designed to simulate a real-world scenario where users interact with a service and an admin oversees the operations.

## Features

### RDBMS Features
- **Table creation** with column types (`INT`, `TEXT`)
- **Primary keys** support
- **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- **Basic JOIN query** for combining tables
- **In-memory storage** (for demonstration purposes)
- **SQL-like commands** and parser

### Web Application Features
- **User Sign Up/Login**
- **User Orders**
    - Place new orders
    - View own orders
    - Cancel order
- **Admin Dashboard**
    - View all users
    - Manage users (update/delete)
    - View all orders
    - Manage orders (update status)
    - View orders joined with user details
- **Simple navigation** between User and Admin views
- **Responsive and clean interface** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **Frontend was developed with the help of Claude AI** to fasten prototyping, generate clean UI/UX layouts, and ensure a visually appealing interface while focusing on backend logic and RDBMS implementation.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Kotlin, Ktor (embedded Netty server)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (prototyped using Claude AI)
- **Database Engine:** Custom in-memory RDBMS implemented in Kotlin
- **Serialization:** JSON (through Ktor’s ContentNegotiation plugin)

```

## How It Works

1. **Users** sign up with a name, and password, and the id is autogenerated.
2. Signed-up users can **place, view and delete orders**.
3. The **admin** can view all users and orders, update usernames, delete users, update order statuses, and view a **join table** combining orders with user information.
4. All interactions use **REST API endpoints**, and the frontend dynamically renders the data in tables.

The **join table** simulates a real-world scenario such as **seeing which orders belong to which users**,  which can be useful in dashboards for monitoring customer activity.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Java 17+**
- **Gradle 7+**
- A modern browser for the frontend

### Run the Application

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:EstherNyumu/Mini-RDBMS-Web-App-Kotlin.git
   cd mini-rdbms


2. Build and run the server:

    ```bash
    ./gradlew run
   ```
   
   This starts the Ktor server on port 8080, bound to all network interfaces (0.0.0.0).

3. Open your browser and navigate to:

    http://localhost:8080

    **Note:** `0.0.0.0:8080` allows the server to accept connections from other devices on your network.
    For local testing, use http://localhost:8080.  
    If port `8080` is busy, change the port in **Main.kt**:
    
    ```kotlin
    embeddedServer(Netty, port = 8081) { ... }.start(wait = true)
    ```
   
4. Use the **Signup View** to create a user, then place orders.

5. Switch to **Admin View** to manage users and orders.

## Notes
- This is an **in-memory database**. All data is lost when the server stops.

- The app demonstrates RDBMS concepts: tables, CRUD operations, primary keys, and joins.

- Designed for learning and portfolio purposes.

- Frontend development was accelerated using Claude AI, allowing focus on backend logic while producing a professional UI layout.

---

## Future Improvements
- Persistent storage using SQLite

- User authentication using JWT

- Role-based access control

- Better error handling and validations

- Pagination for large datasets

- Enhanced UI/UX
